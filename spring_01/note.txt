* UNet based Arch:
encoder-decoder with skip connection or modify dual branch configuration (paper 1 and 14), teach student structure (12, 15, 19), 3D extensions (9, 13, 21, 24)

* Vision Transformers:
ViT, Swin Transformer in 11, 14, 25, 26 or hybrid CNN+Vit in 11 and 14 where CNN branches capture local spatial feature and Vit branches model global contextual dependencies, pure transformer based models on 25 and 26

* Novel/Specialized archs:
    • Implicit Neural Representation (INR) (5)
    • cascaded registration network (24)
    • triple-branch V-Net (31)
    
    
* Pseudo mask:
    • CAM + threshold (3, 4, 25): apply threshold (0.5-0.6) to produce binary masks
    • Dynamic Label Ensembling (EMA) (14, 15, 19, 12): teacher-student paradigm using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) where the teacher model produces soft predictions that supervise the student, paper 14 uses random beta-weighted ensembling between CNN and ViT teachers for refinement, paper 11 operates in the frequency domain, decomposing predictions via Haar wavelet transform before mixing low-frequency (shape) and high-frequency (boundary) components independently
    • Adaptive Regional Growth (18, 30): traditional computer vision algorithms 
    • CAM + Geodesic Refinement (6): uncertainty-weighted multi-resolution fusion followed by geodesic seed expansion
    • CAM + Level Set (DRLSE) (27): uses DRLSE level set evolution as a physics-inspired refinement tool across MRI modalities
    • CAM + Texture Knowledge (23): integrates external texture knowledge (GLCM features and fuzzy K-means clustering)
    • Frequency-Domain Mixing (11)
    • Atlas-based Registration (9, 24)
    • Supervoxel Propagation (SLIC) (29)
    • Bounding Box CRF (21)
    • Gaussian Mask Simulation (20)
    • 2D to 3D Prism Extension (5): bridges 2D annotations to 3D by extending pixels into spatial prisms
    • No Pseudo Mask (MIL) (2): Multiple Instance Learning bags constructed via parallel/polar image transformations
    • No Pseudo Mask (Consistency) (8): propagates point annotations using a consistency loss between adjacent slices
    • Regression Pre-training (RANO) (32): enforces consistency between modalities via MSE loss without ever generating explicit pseudo labels


* Datasets:
    • ACDC (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge 2017) in 8 papers
    • BraTS (2018–2023) in 7 papers
    • INSTANCE2022 (Intracranial Hemorrhage CT) in 2 papers (23, 25)


* Metrics:
    • Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) in all the papers
    • the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) for boundary accuracy
    • Jaccard/IoU for overlap
    • Sensitivity and Specificity
    • Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD)
    • AUC-ROC for classification, PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction in 17
    
    
* Limitations:
    • generalization (can validate on one or two datasets)
    • errors on pseudo masks 
    • computational cost: UM-CAM in 6 with 7h training, MC Dropout in 5 with 133 min vs 33 min standard, ScribSD+ in 12 with double GPU memory
    • dataset only from one institutions
